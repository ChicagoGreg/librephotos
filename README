# For common users:
Set the needed variables in .env (take librephotos.env as model)
Just pull the repo and run
docker-compose up -d
This will get the pre-built images and start all the needed processes

# For developers:
Set the needed variables in .evn (take librephotos.env as model)
Also set the codedir variable that tells docker where your source folder are
Pull frontend code into ${codedir}/frontend/
Pull backend code into ${codedir}/backend/
Pull this repo and run
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
This will build images from scratch (can take a long time)
Now you can develop and benefit from code auto reload from both backend and frontend
